This is the main repository for the project "LLM-assisted consenting for Personal Genome Project enrollment exam".

This repository is used to track work and feedback. Please watch this space for links to sub-projects where code, documentation, and relevant resources will be organized in their repos.

The goal of this project is to improve the PGP enrollment process with the help of LLMs. We will create a simple LLM application that takes a source document and outputs written exam questions (with answers) in English that can be used to test a readerâ€™s comprehension of that document. We will apply the code to the [PGP Study Guide](https://my.pgp-hms.org/static/v20120430-study-guide.pdf) and improve the current enrollment exam. We will also write practical instructions to the PGP personnel administering the enrollment and help them make the best use of LLM-generated content.
